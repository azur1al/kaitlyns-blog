<p>Subject: An apology</p>
<br>
<p>Hey, Emma.</p>
<p>Long time no talk.</p>
<p>First things first, I’m sorry. </p>
<p>I’m sorry for all that has happened, I’m sorry that I wasn’t there for you when you needed me, and I’m sorry for taking my frustrations out on you, you didn’t deserve that at all. I’m sorry. You have every right to ignore this email. You have every right to hate me. You have every right to have nothing to do with this family ever again.</p>
<p>Even so, you deserve to know the truth.</p>
<p>I know you probably don’t want this. I know that you need to believe that she is happy out there, somewhere, even if it means that she left you without a word. But you need to know what happened. Where she is. Where they all are.</p>
<p>She never told you, I never told you, but Kait had a blog. You know, she wrote about you an awful lot. You need to read through it. Start from the start and work your way back to the present. The answers are all in there. </p>
<p>I’ve linked a locked ZIP file which you’ll be able to open once you find the answers.</p>
<p>Whatever you decide to do, I hope that you can find it within yourself to forgive me, that you can find peace and closure in the answers.</p>
<p>Take care of yourself,</p>
<p>- Laura ♡</p>
