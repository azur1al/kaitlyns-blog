        I'm going to be going away for a while. A trip to
        <a href="/the-seaside.html">Europe!</a> It's going
        to be a lot of fun. I promise to tell you all about it later.

    <div class="content">
      <p>
        Hey everyone! Welcome to the new website! I hope that you were able to
        find it without too many issues!
      </p>
      <p>
        The old website will probably stay up for a while until most of you find
        your way here, then I'll be taking it down. I know that a lot of you
        expressed that you were hoping for me to keep the old website going but
        to be honest it was taking a lot of time and energy to keep it running
        and I'm hoping this fresh start will give me more motivation to write
        more often!
      </p>
      <p>
        I hope that all of you are having a good start to the year! I went to
        the beach and watched the midnight fireworks from the city with my
        friends. My mother came along, too. She was really excited to meet Em.
        They seemed to get along well, which I'm incredibly grateful for! I was
        worried that they might clash, but after seeing them talk for so long
        last night I’m shocked I ever thought that in the first place.
      </p>
      <p>
        The ocean was really cold, but we went for our first swim of the year a
        few minutes after midnight. The waves were a bit strong, but I think we
        all had a good time! Em even found a really pretty shell. She gave it to
        me. I think I’ll put it on my bookshelf.
      </p>
      <p>
        I know I've said it many times before, but I really appreciate all of
        you! You’ve all been supporting me from the sidelines for so long now I
        feel like we’re a little family! Thank you for being my digital
        cheerleaders.
      </p>
      <p>Talk again soon!</p>

              Nice website! I'm really liking the background. Super cute! It's
              nice to hear about your mum and Em getting along, I know that
              caused you quite a bit of anxiety. I've been having a pretty
              relaxed start to the year! I'm hoping to soak up as much freedom
              as I can before school starts up again lol.

                  well. ive been doing well as well. i spent new years with some
                  family n friends at my fathers house n played minecraft til
                  3am. it was great. i think one of my cousins leaked my number
                  to the server we were playing on cuz i keep getting calls from
                  someone. its super creepy! all they do is ask if i remember.
