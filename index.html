            Hi! Welcome to my little corner of the internet where I like to talk
            about everything and anything that takes my fancy :)
          </p>
          <p>
            I don't always post very often, but I hope that you enjoy the small
            glimpses into my life that I do provide, and that you're able to find a
            friend in me. Thank you so much to all my lovely digital
            cheerleaders! You really make my day!

      <p>Hey guys,</p>
      <p>I hope you’re all well.</p>
      <p>
        I know what you’re thinking – two updates in one month? Something crazy
        must’ve happened!
      </p>
      <p>
        Unfortunately, it’s nothing that brilliant. I’m here to announce that
        this blog will be going on an
        <a href="/whatdidyoudo.html">indefinite hi4tus</a>, I’m so sorry but I
        won’t be able to post for the next few months and honestly, I’m thinking
        I might start over (again!). I hope that you’ll stay by my side for the
        next chapter, but if you’re leaving the cheerleading squad now I won’t
        blame you. It was a blessing to know you all!
      </p>
      <p>Thank you for everything, love you all,</p>

    <div class="content">
      <p>
        Hey everyone! Welcome to the new website! I hope that you were able to
        find it without too many issues!
      </p>
      <p>
        The old website will probably stay up for a while until most of you
        <a href="/mp-km.html">find your way h3re</a>, then I'll be taking it
        down. I know that a lot of you expressed that you were hoping for me to
        keep the old website going but to be honest it was taking a lot of time
        and energy to keep it running and I'm hoping this fresh start will give
        me more motivation to write more often!
      </p>
      <p>
        I hope that all of you are having a good start to the year! I went to
        the beach and watched the midnight fireworks from the city with my
        friends. My mother came along, too. She was really excited to meet Em.
        They seemed to get along well, which I'm incredibly grateful for! I was
        worried that they might clash, but after seeing them talk for so long
        last night I’m shocked I ever thought that in the first place.
      </p>
      <p>
        The ocean was really cold, but we went for our first swim of the year a
        few minutes after midnight. The waves were a bit strong, but I think we
        all had a good time! Em even found a really pretty shell. She gave it to
        me. I think I’ll put it on my bookshelf.
      </p>
      <p>
        I know I've said it many times before, but I really appreciate all of
        you! You’ve all been supporting me from the sidelines for so long now I
        feel like we’re a little family! Thank you for being my digital
        cheerleaders.
      </p>
      <p>Talk again soon!</p>

              Nice website! I'm really liking the background. Super cute! It's
              nice to hear about your mum and Em getting along, I know that
              caused you quite a bit of anxiety. I've been having a pretty

      <p>
        Hey everyone! I hope you are all doing well as we make our way through
        the second month of the year!
      </p>
      <p>
        I was really pleased to see everyone’s comments on my last post, I’m so
        glad that the site wasn’t too difficult to find. I’ve taken down the old
        blog now, so hopefully you’ve all found your way over. Hopefully a few
        new cheerleaders join the squad as well!
      </p>
      <p>
        This month has been absolutely fantastic so far! As you can probably all
        guess, I spent <a href="/a-love-letter.html">Valentin8s Day</a> with
        Emma. It was a lot of fun! I got Emma a matching infinity necklace which
        she absolutely adored. I’m pretty relieved honestly because I wasn’t
        sure how she’d feel about me giving her a near copy of something she got
        me, but yeah! She loved it. Now we match!
      </p>
      <p>
        We pretty much spent all day at the beach, eating lots of sandy fruit
        and seagull-hunted fish and chips… We got some really good ice cream
        too, it was a new place near the pier, I can definitely see us going
        there more often!
      </p>
      <p>
        Anyways, it was a really brilliant day, and I hope that all of you had
        an equally fantastic day!
      </p>
      <p>Talk again soon :D</p>

    <label for="title4">《 Happy Birthday to Me!!! 》✦ March 20th, 2019</label>

    <div class="content">
      <p>Happy birthday to me~!</p>
      <p>
        I hope that you’re all having a great month so far! It’s been a pretty
        good one for me (certainly for many reasons other than it being my
        birthday month) though it’s also been pretty busy! I was hoping to get a
        post out before my birthday, but I was swept away with study and work
        that I had to make you all wait until now… I hope it’s worth it!
      </p>
      <p>
        First things first, my birthday. Well, it went pretty well! I invited a
        lot of my friends, of course including Emma and Laura, to do some laser
        tag and bowling together. It was a lot of fun! Definitely recommend it,
        even if you have terrible aim and awful bowling capabilities like I do.
      </p>
      <p>
        Emma got me a really beautiful necklace of an infinity symbol with our
        initials engraved on the back. You have to get a magnifying glass to see
        them! So cool!
      </p>
      <p>
        Laura got me a really cool fantasy book! I’m really excited to read
        through it, apparently she got the same book so that we can both read it
        and discuss it at the same pace together! I’m really looking forwards to
        it.
      </p>
      <p>
        My mum got me a BUNCH of sweets and a really nice new phone case to
        replace my old one, it’s so cool! Definitely showing it off to everyone.
        Can’t wait to eat all the sweets in one sitting, lol.
      </p>
      <p>
        My dad got me a <a href="/doyouremember.html">su1tcase</a>, which was
        kinda weird! It’s a real fancy one, pretty big! He said something about
        wanting to take me and mum to Europe one day, and this being the first
        step in that direction. I’m not sure where I’m going to put it until
        then but oh well! Cool suitcase!
      </p>
      <p>
        Anyways, I had an absolute blast these past few days, and I hope you’ve
        all had a great month too!
      </p>
      <p>Talk again soon!</p>

              Ohhh which fantasy book did you get? I love fantasy books! I'm glad that you had a great birthday with your friends and family. I have to say that a suitcase is a pretty odd gift, but I guess he had good intentions.

    <label for="title5">《 Music Festival w Emma! 》✦ April 12th, 2019</label>

    <div class="content">
      <p>Hey everyone! I hope you’re all doing well!</p>
      <p>
        This past month has been pretty busy, I just got home from a really fun
        music festival with Emma! I’ve always thought of music festivals to be
        super rowdy (and muddy), but this festival was really relaxed (and
        clean)! I picked up so many CDs I don’t want to think about how much
        money I spent, but at least I have some really cool additions to my
        growing collection, lol.
      </p>
      <p>
        There were some really lovely musicians there, a lot of them were really
        skilled and really kind, I already can’t wait until next year’s
        festival!
      </p>
      <p>
        Ah, <a href="/a-falling-tear.html">s0rry</a> guys but I’m going to have
        to end it there, I have to go!
      </p>
      <p>Stay well and we’ll talk again soon!</p>

    <div class="content">
      <p>
        Hey everyone! I hope you are all well and that this past month has been
        going smoothly for you all. This month has been pretty quiet for me! Not
        much on, mostly just school and work and chores, lol.
      </p>
      <p>
        I think that the highlight of the month was definitely going and hanging
        out with Laura at the park! We had this whole picnic and laid out like 5
        blankets on the ground, it was so nice! There was cake (kindly donated
        by my <a href="/mp-sm.html">moth3r</a>) and biscuits and some super
        overpriced fruits, and we spent almost the entire time cloud gazing and
        admiring the golden leaves on the trees.
      </p>
      <p>
        Definitely recommend going on a picnic this time of year! The weather
        has been really nice here. I hope that it’s been nice for all of you,
        too!
      </p>
      <p>
        Well, short update today, but thank you for continuing to cheer me on!
        Talk again soon! :D

    <label for="title7">《 Medieval Fayre!!! 》✦ June 23rd, 2019</label>

    <div class="content">
      <p>Hey everyone! I hope you’re all doing well!</p>
      <p>
        You know, I never thought that a medieval fayre would be my kind of
        thing, but over the weekend mum and I went to one and we had an absolute
        blast! The musicians were amazing, the sword battles were super intense,
        and the horses for the jousting were stunning.
      </p>
      <p>
        Mum and I both dressed up, we had a costume planned out for dad, too,
        but he was in a bit of a
        <a href="/a-twisted-heart.html">bad moo6</a> and decided not to go with
        us. The costumes were really nice, a bit scratchy but they looked so
        cool! I took loads of photos, I’ll set one as the blog background so you
        all can see!
      </p>
      <p>
        There were so many really cool people there in costumes that they must
        have spent an awful lot of time (and money) on. I wish that one day I
        get to be as cool as they are!
      </p>
      <p>
        We’re six months in to the year, now, can you believe it? I sure can’t.
        It only feels like yesterday that I set this blog up! I hope that the
        first half of the year has been going well for all.
      </p>
      <p>Thank you again for all of your cheers! Talk again soon!</p>

              I've always loved medieval fayres, they're always so much fun and full of really cool people. The dedication some people put into their costumes is insane! I totally understand the 'wanting to be them' thing. Thank you for another great post :)

    <label for="title8">《 Polaroid 》✦ July 10th, 2019</label>

    <div class="content">
      <p>Hey everyone! I hope you’re all doing well!</p>
      <p>
        It’s been a bit of a slow month for me as the dreary winter keeps on
        going and going and going… Seriously, a bit tired of it now. Can’t wait
        for spring, at least it’s not so chilly the rest of the year because I
        seriously think I couldn’t take a whole year of chill. I can’t believe
        that some people prefer the winter months to the summer months. Crazy.
      </p>
      <p>
        Anyways, I’ve had a few nice days this month, Emma came over to our
        house for a weekend and we watched some funny movies together, like this
        one where the entire world is made out of cake. Super weird! I made her
        some popcorn, and she said it was the best she had ever tasted,
        apparently, she’s been eating sugared popcorn her entire life (outside
        of cinemas) and never considered making salt and butter popcorn for
        herself at home before. So, I was more than happy to enlighten her and
        teach her how to make it.
      </p>
      <p>
        We took some polaroid photos together to hang on my wall, I have a
        little string with pegs I’m hoping to fill with photos of people I love.
        Mum is on there already, so is <a href="doyoufeelregret">d4d</a>, and
        Laura, and now Emma, too! I think most of the photos will be of Emma.
      </p>
      <p>Well, that’s it for this month, take care and talk again soon!</p>

              The polaroids are such a cute idea! I don't have a polaroid camera but if I did I would totally be doing the same thing. It's a really cute way of remembering people :)

        Hey, everyone! I hope you’ve been keeping out of the wet weather and are
        all doing well :)
      </p>
      <p>
        This week has been really crazy weather-wise! Laura came over to stay
        for the weekend and ended up staying for the whole week because of the
        flood waters. Luckily, we had a lot of shows and movies we had on DVD
        that we needed to catch each other up on, otherwise I think we would’ve
        been bored out of our brains after exhausting the last dredges of gossip
        lol.
      </p>
      <p>
        Dad was lucky to escape it all, off on a work trip or something, but I’m
        sure he won’t be happy when he comes home to find a branch of the big
        gum on our lawn. I think it’s cute, it was very kind to not fall
        straight on top of us.
      </p>
      <p>
        I hope that you’re all safe and
        <a href="/the-park.html">dry at h0me</a> and not having to worry about
        your safety.
      </p>
      <p>Stay safe and we’ll talk again soon!</p>

      <p>Hey everyone! I hope you’re all doing well!</p>
      <p>
        I hope that this month has been treating you all well and that you’ve
        been enjoying the spring weather so far! I know that I have and that
        Emma hasn’t (hayfever).
      </p>
      <p>
        I don’t think I’ve told you all before, but my mum is super into
        photography and she’s crazy good at it too. Her photos are always super
        gorgeous, and she doesn’t even use photoshop to clean them up or
        anything. It’s not just me that thinks they’re brilliant either because
        she recently won a competition! It was a super fancy competition, too,
        lots of posh people in fancy dress and expensive alcohol. I’m super
        proud of her for winning, she deserves the recognition (and the award
        money).
      </p>
      <p>
        Speaking of award money, it was a crazy amount! We went out to dinner
        together at a nearby restaurant and it was really fancy and really good.
        It’s a shame <a href="/mp-him.html">d4d</a> wasn’t with us because they
        had his favourite food, too. Next time!
      </p>
      <p>
        Anyways, please congratulate my mum for her amazing achievement! I’m
        super proud of her and I hope that you all are too.
      </p>
      <p>Take care of yourself and talk again soon!</p>

      <p>Hey everyone! I hope you’re all doing well!</p>
      <p>
        This month was pretty quiet! I got to meet up again with Emma, we had a
        lot of fun going from op shop to op shop to find bits and pieces for a
        costume that she’s working on for an upcoming convention, I got some
        nice bits and bobs for the next medieval fayre that I can’t wait to show
        mum!
      </p>
      <p>
        I got to see Laura, too! Dad took the both of us fishing after we kept
        joking with him about how boring it was. We went to a local
        <a href="/the-wetlands.html">wetl4nd</a> – they have like this special
        area just for fishing where they breed fish for people to catch, which
        was pretty cool! It had this little wooden hut to protect from rain, a
        pier out to the water, and a little barbeque for cooking your catches! I
        didn’t end up catching anything, but Laura did a great job!
      </p>
      <p>
        I haven’t been up to too much otherwise, how about you guys? I hope
        you’re all doing well! Talk again soon :)

      <p>Hey everyone! I hope that you’ve been doing well this past month!</p>
      <p>
        I’ve had a lovely month, mostly spending time with Emma which I’m sure
        you’re all so terribly bored by by now lol. We went to a new bowling
        alley and tried it out – it was great, but the chips were absolutely
        awful, overall rating of maybe 6/10. The animations were beautifully
        cringe-worthy.
      </p>
      <p>
        I actually went to the <a href="/the-seaside.html">b3ach</a> yesterday
        with Laura, the weather was awful, sand stabbing into our skin like
        pins, but we braved it anyways. Totally worth it. We had a really long
        talk about life, being all philosophic and stuff, like proper adults
        lol. Can’t wait for the weather to clear up already so we can go have
        some proper fun!
      </p>
      <p>I hope you’ve all been well! Talk again soon!</p>

              I absolutely love the beach. I don't think I could ever live without it. That and bowling alleys with horrid animations that look more like a horror film than a celebration... Thanks for the update!

              the cringey-er the better. sounds like that was more of a battle of survival than a fun trip to the beach, but im glad u had a good time. stay well.
